<p align="center"><b>10 Things You Didn't Know About Albert Einstein:</b></p>
<ul style="font-style: 2%;">
	<li>He never failed math. This is a popular "fact" promoted on the internet, maybe in an attempt to relate to genius.However, it is simply not true. Overall, Eistein was an average student, but math was one area where he excelled, unsuprisingly.</li>
	<li>Eistein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His involvement is often misinterpreted, with some claiming he helped create the atomic bomb. In reality, what he did was write a letter to President FDR encouraging him to begin work on such a weapon, which led to the Manhattan Project. Although a dedicated pacifist and, later, an anti-nuke spokesman, Eistein was convinced the America needed the atomic bomb before the Nazia.</li>
	<li>He was a great musician. if the whole "genius" thing didn't work out, Eistein could have become a violinist. His mother played piano so he had the love of music instilled in him<sup>_</sup>via violin lessons<sup>_</sup>at the age of five.</li>
	<li>He could have been the President of Isreal. When Isreal's first president, Chaim Weizmann, died, Eistein was offered the position, but he declined.</li>
	<li>He married his cousin. After Eistein divorced his first wife, Mileva Maric, he married his cousin, Elsa Lowenthal. He was, actually, quite a bad husband to his first wife in their later years. He had affairs he never tried to hide, he moved the entire family to Berlin without discussion, and treated her more as a servant than a wife.</li>
	<li>He won the Noble Prize for Physics. This alone isn't particularly surprising. What is suprising is the fact that he didn't receive it for the general theory of relativity, but rather for the photoelectric effect.</li>
	<li>He loved to sail. Ever since university, Eistein sailed as a hobby. But by his own admission, he never made a particularly good sailor. In fact, he didn't even know how to swim.</li>
	<li>He really didn't like socks and usually didn't wear them. In fact, in a letter to Elsa, he bragged about getting away "without wearing socks" while at Oxoford.</li>
	<li>He had an illegitimate daughter. This wasn't known until the 1980s, but according to the correspodence between Albert and Mileva it was determined that the two had a daughter in 1902 called Lieserl. At a point, all mention of her in letters stopped so her fate is known.</li>
